* fecundity for 1SW and 2SW females, close life cycle by calculating next-generation eggs

* layer in which user can select 1,2,3 yr old smolts and have the code figure out what parameter set that corresponds to.

	s1 (1 year old smolt) = 6 mo in parr, smolt length 13 cm (12-14)
	s2 = 18 mo in parr, smolt length 13.5 cm (12-14.5). Additional mortaliy of 20%
	s3 = 30 mo in parr, smolt length 14 cm (12-15). Additional additional 20% mortality

* likewise, choice of 1SW/2SW returners

	1SW: adult length 60cm (compensating for smolt size differences among s1,s2,s3)
	2SW: adult length 75cm (likewise)

* adult coastal stage (stage 8, 2 mos) should set separate, user-settable mortality.

	baseline value 10%
	
	re-tuning marine mortality for the Bush:
	1SW: survival (stages 5-8) = 2.7% lowest , 4.9% mean and 11.7% highest
	2SW: 0.1% , 0.75%, and 1.8%
